When first running the program, the default login information as follows:
Username: 'admin'
Password: 'admin'

WARNING! Do not run the test functions before running the main program first.
During so could result in the database not being created correctly which will cause
the program not to functions

Possible problems & Solutions:

Login not working:
    Make sure that the database has been created. It should be named login.db. If the
    database does exist you might need to delete it and re-run the program.

Database not being found:
    Ensure that the database is in the same location as your code. A proper file
    placement example is show below:

        >Python_Projects
            >Spring 2022
                >Login.Py
                >login_test.py
                >login.db
                >Readme.txt

Program not working:
    Sometimes code editors like visual studio code has a problem running files, 
    so sometimes closing and reopening visual studio can fix your problem
